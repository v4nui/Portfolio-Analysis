# Portfolio Analysis Tech Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed as a tech challenge for learning purposes. The notebook performs a detailed portfolio analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of performance metrics. This project was designed to explore and analyze various aspects of a financial portfolio, providing insights into asset allocation, risk, and return.

## Overview

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a portfolio to evaluate its performance and risk characteristics. The notebook walks through several key steps:

- **Data Preparation:** Importing and cleaning financial data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating trends and patterns in the data.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculating returns, risk measures, and diversification metrics.
- **Visualization:** Generating interactive charts and graphs to illustrate key insights.
- **Interpretation:** Summarizing findings to inform investment decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12.4**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- (Additional libraries may include scikit-learn, seaborn, etc., if used in your analysis)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12.4
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`, if provided)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v4nui/Portfolio-Analysis
   cd Portfolio-Analysis
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `Tech-Challenge.ipynb` notebook file.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Project Insights

The notebook offers a step-by-step breakdown of the portfolio analysis, including:

- **Data visualization:** Graphical representation of portfolio trends.
- **Performance evaluation:** Insights into return profiles and volatility.
- **Risk assessment:** Analysis of risk measures to evaluate portfolio stability.
- **Asset allocation:** Breakdown of how different assets contribute to overall performance.
